# Technology Stack and Thanks

This page captures the core technologies Smith currently depends on, and acknowledges the projects that inspired its design direction.

## Core Runtime and Control Plane Technologies

- Go (`go 1.25.0`) for core services and CLI (`smith-api`, `smith-chat`, `smith-core`, `smith-replica`, `smith`).
- etcd (`go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3`) as the authoritative store for loop state, locks, journals, handoffs, overrides, and audit records.
- PostgreSQL (`github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`) for document metadata in `postgres-garage` document backend mode.
- Garage S3-compatible object storage (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3`) for document content blobs in `postgres-garage` mode.
- Kubernetes (`k8s.io/api`, `k8s.io/apimachinery`, `k8s.io/client-go`) as the execution substrate for control-plane deployments and replica Jobs.
- Helm (`helm/smith`) for packaging and deploying Smith components.
- Docker (`docker/*.Dockerfile`) for container images.
- [block/goose](https://github.com/block/goose) as the chat agent runtime (ACP) behind the Smith chat service.

## Local Development and Environment Tooling

- vCluster for local multi-cluster-style integration workflows.
- k3d for local Kubernetes cluster provisioning.
- `make` + shell scripts (`scripts/integration`, `scripts/test`) for repeatable developer workflows and test orchestration.

## Interfaces and Operator Surfaces

- HTTP/JSON API (`cmd/smith-api`) for loop ingress, control, auth lifecycle, and reporting.
- Chat API (`cmd/smith-chat`) for chat sessions, SSE streaming responses, and action commits.
- CLI (`cmd/smith`) for operator automation and scripting.
- Console web shell (`console/`) for operator-facing runtime configuration and UI surface.

## Testing and Verification Tooling

- Go test for unit/integration coverage.
- Godog (`github.com/cucumber/godog`) for BDD acceptance scenarios.
- Testify (`github.com/stretchr/testify`) for assertions and test helpers.
