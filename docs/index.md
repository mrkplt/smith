# Smith Documentation

**A Distributed Runtime for Autonomous Software Development**

Smith is a distributed runtime designed to execute autonomous development loops across a cluster of machines. By combining Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), GitHub Issues, and automated validation workflows, Smith enables software systems to continuously build themselves.

## Core Concepts

- **Anomaly:** A discrete unit of work, bug, or task. In the Smith metaphor, an anomaly represents a deviation from the desired state of the system that must be resolved.
- **upstream tooling Loops:** Structured feedback loops that externalize state into the repository, enabling long-running autonomous progress.
- **Choreography:** A decentralized approach to development where PRDs define goals and agents react to repository state.
- **Continuous Implementation:** A shift from traditional CI/CD pipelines to an autonomous `plan -> implement -> validate -> iterate` loop.

## Philosophy

- **No Personified Agents:** Execution units are homogeneous, omnicapable, and designed for uniform horizontal replication.
- **Scale Beyond the Local Machine:** Using etcd + Kubernetes as the control substrate allows development activity to scale across distributed compute while preserving deterministic state and traceability.
- **Repository-Based Coordination:** The repository is the shared coordination layer where autonomous loops cooperate.
- **Inspiration:** The design is influenced by upstream tooling, [marcus/sidecar](https://github.com/marcus/sidecar), [marcus/td](https://github.com/marcus/td), and related work.
