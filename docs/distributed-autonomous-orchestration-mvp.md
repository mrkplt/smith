# Smith MVP: Distributed Autonomous Orchestration

## Intent

Deliver Smith as a **Distributed Runtime for Autonomous Software Development** where:
- **Product Requirements** are turned into running software through autonomous development loops.
- **upstream tooling Loops** are distributed across infrastructure, reading PRDs and contributing improvements to the codebase.
- **etcd** serves as the authoritative state machine for these distributed loops.
- **Kubernetes Jobs** execute the replica workers, scaling development activity horizontally.
- **Operator API and CLI** provide ingress, control, and visibility.

## Philosophy

### Terminology & Theme (The "Smith" Metaphor)

Smith's design and terminology are inspired by *The Matrix* and related cyberpunk themes. This metaphor defines the system's core entities:

- **Smith:** The project's namesake. Like Agent Smith, the orchestrator is a program designed to maintain system order and "resolve" deviations.
- **Anomaly:** A unit of work, bug, or unfinished feature. An anomaly is any state in the repository that deviates from the desired requirements (the PRD).
- **Replica:** A homogeneous worker instance. Replicas are spawned to resolve specific anomalies, echoing Agent Smith's ability to replicate himself to handle multiple tasks.
- **The Matrix:** The collective state of all loops and anomalies stored in `etcd`, representing the shared reality that all components observe.
- **Operator:** The human controller (you) who manages the system from outside the "Matrix" using `smith` or the Console.

### Lifecycle States

The loop lifecycle transitions follow the same thematic naming convention:

- **Unresolved:** The initial state. An anomaly has been detected and recorded in the Matrix, but no replica has been assigned to it yet.
- **Overwriting:** The active state. A replica pod is running and actively "overwriting" the repository's source code to eliminate the anomaly.
- **Synced:** The success state. The replica has verified its changes and successfully synchronized them to the remote repository.
- **Flatline:** The failure state. The replica was unable to resolve the anomaly within the allowed attempts, or a fatal error occurred. The loop has "flatlined" and requires manual triage or override.
- **Cancelled:** The termination state. An operator has manually stopped the loop before it could reach a terminal `synced` or `flatline` state.

### Choreography, Not Orchestration

Smith uses choreography to coordinate development work. There is no central controller dictating every step. Instead, PRDs define goals, GitHub issues define tasks, and tests define correctness. Agents react to the shared repository state.

### Distributed, Not Local

Smith moves beyond a single-machine local file-system model. By using etcd + Kubernetes as a distributed control substrate, development loops can scale across broad compute while preserving deterministic state, auditability, and resumability.

### Homogeneous Workers, Not Personas

Smith intentionally does not personify agents.
- Execution units are intentionally homogeneous and omnicapable.
- Scale comes from replicating the same worker contract many times.
- The system design favors neutral orchestration primitives (state transitions, leases/locks, jobs, journals, and handoffs) over persona-specific behavior.

The implementation is influenced by upstream tooling, [marcus/sidecar](https://github.com/marcus/sidecar), [marcus/td](https://github.com/marcus/td), and similar projects.

## Architecture

### Control Plane Components

- `smith-core` (Deployment)
  - Watches etcd loop state keys.
  - Acquires per-loop lock before scheduling work.
  - Creates and monitors Replica Jobs.
  - Reconciles etcd state with Kubernetes runtime.
- `smith-api` (Deployment)
  - Exposes ingress and control APIs (`/v1/loops`, `/v1/ingress/*`, `/v1/control/*`).
  - Performs authn/authz and emits audited operator actions.
- `smith-console` (Deployment)
  - UI for active loops, journal stream, and override workflows.
- `etcd` (external or in-cluster)
  - Stores anomalies, lifecycle state, locks, journal, handoff, and audit records.

### Data Plane Components

- `smith-replica` (Job)
  - Pulls loop context and prior handoff.
  - Executes autonomous coding cycle.
  - Streams journal entries.
  - Writes completion signal and handoff.

## etcd as Source of Truth

All lifecycle decisions read/write etcd keys. Kubernetes is treated as runtime state that must reconcile back to etcd.

Required key families:
- `/smith/v1/anomalies/{loop_id}`
- `/smith/v1/state/{loop_id}`
- `/smith/v1/journal/{loop_id}/{seq}`
- `/smith/v1/handoffs/{loop_id}/{seq}`
- `/smith/v1/locks/{loop_id}`
- `/smith/v1/overrides/{loop_id}/{seq}`
- `/smith/v1/audit/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{event_id}`

## Core Loop Contract

1. Ingress writes anomaly + initial state (`unresolved`).
2. Core watcher receives unresolved event.
3. Core acquires lock (`/locks/{loop_id}` lease-backed).
4. Core transitions state to `running` and creates Replica Job.
5. Replica writes append-only journal events and heartbeats.
6. On success, Replica writes completion payload + handoff and finalizes loop state to `synced`.
7. On failure/timeout, Core applies retry policy or transitions to `flatline` with reason.
8. Reconciler continuously repairs drift between etcd and Job/Pod reality.

## Concurrency and Safety

- Single-writer enforced with etcd compare-and-swap on lock and state revision.
- Duplicate watch events are tolerated through idempotent transition checks.
- Completion uses revision-checked state transitions to prevent split-brain terminal states.
- Reconciler marks zombie jobs stale and can terminate them under policy.

## Operator Control and Audit

Operator capabilities:
- View loop matrix and live journal.
- Pause/resume/cancel loops.
- Eject running Replica.
- Override loop state with required reason.

Each operator action produces immutable audit entries containing:
- actor
- timestamp
- action
- target loop
- reason
- correlation ID

## Kubernetes-Native Deployment

Helm chart requirements:
- Deploy Core, API, Console Deployments.
- Configure RBAC and service accounts.
- Configure image repository/tag/pull policy via values.
- Configure etcd endpoint/TLS and auth secrets.
- Support local/stage/prod values overlays.

## Current Operator API Surface

- `POST /v1/loops` creates one loop or a batch of loops.
- `GET /v1/loops` lists loop states.
- `GET /v1/loops/{id}` returns loop state with anomaly context (when present).
- `GET /v1/loops/{id}/journal` returns append-only loop journal entries.
- `POST /v1/control/override` applies an operator state override with required reason and audit/journal side effects.
- `POST /v1/ingress/github/issues` and `POST /v1/ingress/prd` ingest external work into loop specs.
- `GET /v1/reporting/cost?loop_id={id}` aggregates token/cost metadata from journal events.
- Provider credentials are configured via provider profile `secret_ref` (API-key backed secret reference model).

## Aspirational Operator API Surface (Not Yet Implemented)

- `GET /v1/loops/{id}/trace?limit=500` to return state, anomaly, journal, handoffs, overrides, and loop-scoped audit records.
- `GET /v1/loops/{id}/handoffs` to return append-only handoff chain for replica resumability analysis.
- `GET /v1/loops/{id}/overrides` to return append-only operator override history.
- `GET /v1/audit?loop_id={id}` to return immutable audit records scoped to a loop (auth required).
- `POST /v1/loops/{id}/control/attach`, `/detach`, and `/command` for authenticated operator interactive control actions.

## MVP Exit Criteria

- Core watcher processes unresolved loops end-to-end.
- Per-loop lock prevents concurrent mutating replicas.
- Journal + handoff trace exists for every loop execution.
- Operator actions are authenticated, authorized, and audited.
- Reconciliation prevents persistent zombie/drift states.
